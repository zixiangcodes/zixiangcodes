👋 Hi, I’m Zack or Zi-Xiang! I'm 28 years old as of 2021. Self-learning to program for a better career! These are my attempts to code.
I’m interested in life, programming, philsophy, politics, thinking, lifting weights, self-improvement, modding video games (and playing them), and of course, Warhammer 40,000. 

💞️ I’m currently learning to improve myself in Python and Lua due to modding AI files in 'Warhammer 40,000 : Dawn of War II - Retribution', which uses 'Scripting at Relic' (SCAR), a variant of LUA.
